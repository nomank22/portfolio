        <p> Hey everyone! I’m Noman Khan (I also go by Nomi, pronounced “NAWmi”), and I’m currently a first-year graduate student
      at the University of Michigan School of Information (UMSI) located in Ann Arbor!
      I’m hoping to specialize in UX Research and Design/Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).
      I was born and raised in Lawrenceville, NJ (near Princeton University), so moving to Ann Arbor this past Fall was definitely a new experience.</p>

        <p> In my free time, I like to watch Youtube, play video games with my friends on my PC or Nintendo Switch,
      and sometimes stream my gaming experience on Twitch.tv, which is a live-streaming platform that allows users
      to stream gaming/variety content and interact with viewers via live chat. It’s been a long time since I’ve streamed since I’ve been busy with school, 
      but I’m hoping to get back into it this Summer! </p>

        <p> Here is my beautiful family! I’ve lived with my aunt and uncle ever since 1st grade due to my parents being deported, so they’re almost my 2nd pair of parents. 
    I also grew up with my sister and 2 cousins, who are pretty much my siblings :). </p>
