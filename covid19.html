    <h1 id="skip">How did COVID-19 impact me?</h1>
        <p> COVID-19 caused a lot of havoc in my life so far. My last semester at Rutgers University as an undergraduate was cut short and had to be fully remote in March along with other universities worldwide.
        This was a huge adjustment because I was used to studying on campus and at my on-campus apartment, due to not having a proper workspace at home.
        My health was compromised in the beginning of March, and I most probably had COVID-19 at the time (even went to urgent care and the ER!). My mental health took a toll, and I needed 
        to pass all my classes to graduate. I found myself writing 2 papers while my virtual graduation occurred, because that's how dire things were at the time!</p>

        <p> I wasn't that disappointed I missed the virtual graduation, because it couldn't really replace a real life graduation experience. Especially given how tough my undergraduate career was and the fact I graduated with a double major,
            I wish things were different - but that's alright. My family felt bad I didn't get to celebrate like they all had done during their graduations, so they surprised me with a graduation party with balloons and decorations, as well as a personalized
            video from friends and family! It was so thoughtful and loving, I'll always cherish it.</p>

        <p> My Uncle who I lived with ever since 1st grade passed away from COVID-19 complications on Dec 21. This was 3 days after my first graduate semester, which was
            very intense due to changing circumstances and the political climate at that time due to the U.S. 2020 Presidential Elections. Coming back to UMSI was super tough in the beginning,
            but with my social support system, I was able to manage things and work hard towards finsihing my classes.</p>
